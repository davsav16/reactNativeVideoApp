# React Native Video App

## Reason For Creation
I created this react app as a way to improve my skills in React Native. I have used React, Next.js, and Typscript in previous projects, but this was my first time in putting those skills to use to develop a native application. 

### Deployed
- This app is not currently deployed on any app store, but you can clone the repo and after running `npm i`, run `npx expo start -c` to view the app on your own device.

### Technologies Used
- Expo
- Native Wind
- Appwrite
- React Native
- Expo AV
- Expo Document Picker
- Expo Image Picker
